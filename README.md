## README for Engima Project:

The attempt was to crack all ciphers. 

Given a large enough sample size, the standard deviation will decrease and 
result in more accurate decrypting.

This project runs on Schooner Supercomputer, thus it's data is scalable for large data sets needed.

The cipher samples used were of type Cryptor: Star of Java David

### To properly run this project.
1) "Rscript Histograph.R" This will compile "dataF.csv" and create "Rplots.pdf"
2) "Python analysis.py"
3) The resulting file is "converted.txt", it shows the frequency base decryption of the input
